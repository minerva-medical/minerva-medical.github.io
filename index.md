## Overview

Welcome to Minerva Medical! The goal of this project is to create and provide an application that keeps track of supply inventory for the Medical Outreach Clinic. 
Our team hopes to create a suitable application that will not only assist the staff at Medical Outreach Clinic, but also assist in providing a smoother patient experience. 

## Goal of the Application
This application will keep track of inventory for items such as medications, vaccinations, lab tests/supplies, and patient supplies. We also intend for the application to keep patient medical records up to date. An example of this is the displaying of information of a vaccine on a patients medical chart if they have received that vaccine. We also have the goal of providing information on the location of each item in their inventory. After completion, we hope to have the staff at Medical Outreach Clinic utilize this application in addition to their medical records application Athena to provide a smoother experience for both the staff and the patients.
